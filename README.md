# C_plus_plus

## Basic concepts

C++ is used to build games, operating sytems, browsers and much more.

Its biggest advantage is its scalability and control over how it uses resources.

First C++ program

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "C++ is fun"
}

main() is the entry point of each program in C++.

A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name.

Data types in C++ include: integers, float, double, char, boolean ...

Comments: //single line,  /*multi line*/


## Conditionals and loops

Decision making: conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

They include:

    if statement, if else statement, if else if statement, switch statement

A loop allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

They include: while loop, do while loop, for loops


## Arrays and pointers

An array stores multiple values in a single variable.

Dynamic allocated memory is used when you don't know what the file size will be.

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.


## Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

Void specifies a function does not return any value.

Overloading functions: defining a function with the same name but different parameter data ypes.
